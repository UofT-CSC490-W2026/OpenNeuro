OpenNeuro is an opensource, locally running AI companion.

## Implementation
OpenNeuro currently consists of three code repositories. To visit them, click on the corresponding git submodule in ```./repos/```.

## Assignments
Assignment pdfs are in its corresponding ```./a{n: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}``` directory.
